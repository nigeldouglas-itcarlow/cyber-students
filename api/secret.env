# Key generated by running the below commands

# key = Fernet.generate_key()
# key

# An encryption key starting with "p-" could indicate that the key is generated using the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
# In PGP, a "p-" prefix is used to indicate the key's type, specifically a "public" key.
# PGP is a widely used encryption system that uses a combination of symmetric-key crypto and public-key cryptography
# In PGP, users have a public key and private key. Public key is used to encrypt messages intended for the user.
# The private key is used to decrypt these messages.
# The "p-" prefix is used to distinguish the public key from the private key

# The "b" prefix indicates that the key is represented in bytes format.
# In Python, a byte string is a sequence of bytes, whereas a regular string is a sequence of Unicode characters.
# The key is encoded using Base64, which is a way of encoding binary data using a set of 64 characters.
# Base64 represents cryptographic keys and binary data in a format that can be easily transmitted over the internet.
